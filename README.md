# pstree
## Introduction
`pstree` is a small program that shows the process listing (`ps`) as a tree (as the name implies...). It has several options to make selection criteria and to change the output style.

It should compile under most Un*xes, tested are AIX, Linux, HP-UX, A/UX, SunOS, Solaris, (Free|Open|Net)BSD, MacOSX/Darwin, and others.

Under AIX & Linux, pstree directly reads the process table using `getproc()`/`getuser()` or the `/proc` file system. Under all other Un*xes, `pstree` reads the output of `/bin/ps`.

## Compilation

Take an ANSI C compiler, e.g., `gcc`, and just enter

    $ [g]cc -O -o pstree pstree.c

There is no `Makefile`.

## Installation

Put the binary `pstree` into appropriate bindir, e.g., `/usr/local/bin`.

Optionally, put the manpage `pstree.1` to, e.g., `/usr/local/share/man/man1`.

## Changes

For changes up to v2.40, see end of `pstree.c`.

Usage: pstree [-f file] [-g n] [-l n] [-u user] [-U] [-s string] [-p pid] [-w] [pid ...]
   -f file   read input from <file> (- is stdin) instead of running
             "ps -eo uid,pid,ppid,pgid,args"
   -g n      use graphics chars for tree. n=1: IBM-850, n=2: VT100, n=3: UTF-8
   -l n      print tree to n level deep
   -u user   show only branches containing processes of <user>
   -U        don't show branches containing only root processes
   -s string show only branches containing process with <string> in commandline
   -p pid    show only branches containing process <pid>
   -w        wide output, not truncated to window width
   pid ...   process ids to start from, default is 1 (probably init)

Process group leaders are marked with '='.
